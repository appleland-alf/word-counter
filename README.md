# word-counter
A word counter that tells you everything about your text

**Note: I'm actively working on this project. Everything I have planned is not fully released.**

This simple software is meant to tell you a basic description of your text, including word count, character count including and excluding spaces, and punctuation count. Below is what I have released and have planned for future additions.

## Milestones

1. Create a word counter that shows the number of words a body of text has.
2. Create a character counter that shows the number of characters, including and excluding spaces, a body of text has.
3. Create a punctuation counter that shows the number of punctuation characters used in a body of text.
